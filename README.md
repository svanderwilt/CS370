An algorithm that can identify features accurately would be very benificial for a variety of reasons.
One I can think of is for customer service reasons.  A business would be able to be notified
immediately if a valued customer comes in.  Another use would be for law enforcement.
Unfortunately, even if there is a minor error in the AI's ability to recognize images, this
could lead to a discrimitory situation among citizens.  Other implications might lead to 
the profiting off of sellling users locations to companies.  Worst of all might be use of
facial recognition to identify Uyghurs and members of other Chinese minority groups (van Noorden, 
2020).  This includes the use of individuals' faces even if they gave concent if the concent is
asked for without full disclosure of use.  Even with full disclosure, once a data set is 
created, it is commonly shared and used in other projects that were not concented to by the
individuals.
